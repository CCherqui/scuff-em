\section{Computation of the fields in \lss geometries}

Consider a point $\vb x$ in some region $\mathcal{R}$
of a \lss geometry. In general, $\mathcal{R}$
will be bounded by some collection of surfaces
$\{\mathcal{S}^s\}$. Let's subdivide the set of 
surfaces bounding $\mathcal{R}$ into two groups:
a first set $\{\mathcal{S}^\alpha\}$ for which
$\mathcal{R}$ is the \textit{exterior} surface,
and a second set $\{\mathcal{S}^\beta\}$ for which
$\mathcal{R}$ is the \textit{interior} surface.
Then the electric field at $\vb x$ is
%====================================================================%
\begin{align} 
E_i(\vb x) 
    = &\hphantom{-} \sum_\alpha \int_{\mathcal{S}^\alpha} 
           \Big\{ \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EE}(\mathcal{R}; \vb x, \vb x^\prime) 
                   K_j(\vb x^\prime)
                  \,+\,
                   \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EM}(\mathcal{R}; \vb x, \vb x^\prime) 
                   N_j(\vb x^\prime)
           \Big\} \, d\vb x^\prime
\nn
     &-\sum_\beta \int_{\mathcal{S}^\beta} 
           \Big\{ \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EE}(\mathcal{R}; \vb x, \vb x^\prime) 
                   K_j(\vb x^\prime)
                  \,+\,
                   \Gamma_{ij}\supt{EM}(\mathcal{R}; \vb x, \vb x^\prime) 
                   N_j(\vb x^\prime)
           \Big\} \, d\vb x^\prime
\nn
     &+E^{\text{\scriptsize inc},r}_i(\vb x).
\label{FieldContributionsEquation}
\end{align}
%====================================================================%
In this equation, $\vb E\incr$ is the field due to any 
incident field sources that lie inside the region $\mathcal{R}^r.$
(The $\vb H$ fields are given by identical relations with 
$\{ \Gamma\supt{EE}, \Gamma\supt{EM}, E\incr\} \to 
 \{ \Gamma\supt{ME}, \Gamma\supt{MM}, H\incr\}$.)

Note the following points with respect to equation
(\ref{FieldContributionsEquation}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sources on surfaces $\mathcal{S}_\alpha$ for which
        $\mathcal{R}$ is the exterior medium  
        contribute to the fields at $\vb x$ 
        with a positive sign.
        Sources on surfaces $\mathcal{S}_\beta$ for which
        $\mathcal{R}$ is the interior medium  
        contribute to the fields at $\vb x$ 
        with a negative sign.

  \item In each line of (\ref{FieldContributionsEquation}), 
        (i.e. regardless of the surface over which we are 
        integrating) the Green's functions used to compute
        the fields at $\vb x$ are the Green's functions for
        the homogeneous region $\mathcal{R}$ containing $\vb x$.
        The material properties of other regions are not
        referenced.
\end{itemize}
