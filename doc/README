# Notes on SCUFF-EM documentation system

## Homer Reid 20150603

I couldn't figure out how to get small-caps text
in markdown, so I developed a kluge, described in 
scuff-em-mkdocs-theme/css/theme_extra.css.

Here's what I did to get inline math working:

1. Install python-markdown-math:

 % git clone https://github.com/mitya57/python-markdown-math.git
 % cd python-markdown-math 
 % python setup.py build
 % sudo python setup.py install
