This directory contains programs and input files for running
SCUFF-EM unit tests.

**************************************************
** .geo and .msh files 
**************************************************

In general, each .msh file is generated from the corresponding
.geo file by running GMSH with the following options:

 % gmsh -clscale 1.0 -2 Geometry.geo -o Geometry.msh

The exception to this rule are meshes whose filenames include
the suffix _Coarse; in this case the .msh files is generated
from the .geo file by running GMSH with 2X larger lengthscale
than above, i.e. 

 % gmsh -clscale 2.0 -2 Geometry_Coarse.geo -o Geometry_Coarse.msh

**************************************************
** matrix unit tests
**************************************************

The two matrix unit-test programs are unit-test-compactMatrix
and unit-test-PBCMatrix. In each case, the code must be run
once with the --WriteFiles option to generate the .hdf5 data
files which are subsequently used as comparisons to test
the proper functionality.

When either of these codes is run with the --WriteFiles option,
it automatically generates an appropriately named .cache 
file. On subsequent runs, the --UseCache option may be 
specified to tell the code to read this .cache file. (If
--UseCache is not specified, the code will not attempt to
read the cache file even if it is present in the working
directory.)
