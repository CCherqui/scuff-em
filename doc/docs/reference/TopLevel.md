# Top-level overview of [[scuff-em]]

[[scuff-em]] is a free, open-source software 
implementation of the boundary-element method (BEM)
(or the "method of moments") of electromagnetic
scattering. (More specifically, [[scuff-em]]
implements the EFIE and PMCHWT formulations
of the BEM using RWG basis functions.)
