This is a Mie scattering code that computes the cross-sections
for absorption, scattering, extinction, and radiation force on
a spherical particle illuminated by a linearly-polarized plane 
wave.

Its only role within scuff-EM is to generate comparison data
for testing scuff-EM's PFT functionality. It uses a technique
which is overly complicated for the purpose at hand.
