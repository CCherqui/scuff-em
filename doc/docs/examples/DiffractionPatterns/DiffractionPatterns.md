# Diffraction patterns for discs, disc arrays, and hole arrays in metal screens

As a final example, we shine a laser beam on a small metallic disc and observe the resulting diffraction pattern on an observation screen located behind the disc. The files for this example are in the `share/scuff-em/examples/DiffractionPatterns` subdirectory of the `scuff-em` source distribution.
