SCUFF-EM
========

A comprehensive and full-featured computational physics suite for 
boundary-element analysis of electromagnetic scattering, 
fluctuation-induced phenomena (Casimir forces and radiative 
heat transfer), nanophotonics, RF device engineering, 
electrostatics, and more. Includes a core library with C++ and 
python APIs as well as many command-line applications.

SCUFF-EM stands for

 Surface-CUrrent-Field Formulation of ElectroMagnetism
